# AWS DeepRacer Student Competition Submissions

Welcome to my AWS DeepRacer Student Competition Submissions repository! Here, you will find a collection of videos showcasing my AWS DeepRacer competition submissions, as well as the code for the reward functions used in these submissions.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized as follows:

- **Videos:** This directory contains video recordings of my AWS DeepRacer competition submissions. Each video is labeled with the corresponding competition and race details.

- **Reward_Functions:** This directory contains the code for the reward functions that were used in the competition submissions. The reward functions are organized by competition and include both Python code and documentation explaining the design and rationale behind each function.

## AWS DeepRacer Student Competitions

The AWS DeepRacer Student Competitions are an exciting opportunity to showcase your skills in reinforcement learning and autonomous driving. In this repository, you will find my submissions for various competitions, along with the reward functions I developed to train my DeepRacer model.

## How to Use

1. **Video Showcase:** You can browse the `Videos` directory to watch my AWS DeepRacer competition submissions. Each video provides a visual representation of the performance of my DeepRacer model in a specific competition.

2. **Reward Functions:** If you are interested in the reward functions I used to train my DeepRacer model, navigate to the `Reward_Functions` directory. Each reward function is contained in its own directory, along with a README file explaining its purpose and implementation details.

## Getting Started

If you're new to AWS DeepRacer or reinforcement learning, here are some steps to get started:

1. **Install AWS DeepRacer:** Follow the instructions on the [AWS DeepRacer Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/deepracer/) to set up your DeepRacer environment.

2. **Clone this Repository:** To access the code and videos in this repository, clone it to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepRacer-Submissions.git
   ```

3. **Explore the Content:** Browse the `Videos` and `Reward_Functions` directories to learn from the competition submissions and reward function implementations.

4. **Experiment:** Feel free to experiment with the code and reward functions provided here. Modify and adapt them to improve your own DeepRacer model.
